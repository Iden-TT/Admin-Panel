/*
This SupplyChain contract includes the functionalities mentioned earlier, such as car registration, maintenance, inspection, ownership transfer, disposal, and payment. It also integrates with the TokenExchange contract to handle payments using tokens.

Note that the TokenExchange contract is imported in the SupplyChain contract and stored as a state variable. The payForService function uses the transferTokens function from the TokenExchange contract to transfer tokens from the user's wallet to the SupplyChain contract.

This implementation is just an example and can be customized according to the specific requirements of the cab booking platform.
