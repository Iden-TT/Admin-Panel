/*
The smart contract is designed to regulate the ride price, check for available drivers in the locality, and select a driver based on their reviews, price bid, distance from the user, and other weighted factors. Let's take a closer look at how this smart contract would work.

Firstly, when a user initiates a ride request, the smart contract would check the location of the user to find available drivers in the locality. Once it identifies the available drivers, the smart contract would fetch their ride price bids, reviews, and distance from the user.

Then, the smart contract would use a weighted factor algorithm to select the most suitable driver for the user. This algorithm would consider several factors such as the ride price bid, driver reviews, and distance from the user. For instance, the smart contract would assign a higher weight to drivers who have better reviews and a lower weight to those who are located far from the user.

After selecting the most suitable driver, the smart contract would calculate the ride price based on the distance and other factors. The price calculation algorithm could also include a surge pricing mechanism to account for peak hours or high demand.

Once the ride is completed, the smart contract would release the payment to the driver based on the agreed-upon price and the terms and conditions of the contract. The smart contract would also provide users with the option to rate and review the driver based on their experience.

The smart contract could also include a dispute resolution mechanism to resolve any disputes that may arise between the user and the driver. This could be done through an arbitration process or other dispute resolution mechanisms included in the smart contract.

Overall this smart contract ensures a fair and transparent ride-hailing service for both users and drivers while utilizing the blockchain's transparency and security features to provide a reliable and trustworthy platform.

To include a dispute resolution mechanism in the smart contract, we can add a function that allows users to initiate a dispute if they are unsatisfied with the ride or if there is any disagreement regarding the fare charged by the driver. This function can be called "initiateDispute".

When a user initiates a dispute, the smart contract can hold the funds in escrow until the dispute is resolved. The smart contract can then notify the driver and ask them to provide their side of the story. The driver can provide any evidence they have, such as a log of the ride, to support their case.

Once both parties have presented their case, a third-party mediator can be appointed. The mediator can be selected by both parties, or the smart contract can randomly select a mediator from a list of trusted mediators.

The mediator can then review the evidence presented by both parties and make a decision on how to resolve the dispute. This decision can be recorded in the smart contract, and the funds held in escrow can be distributed accordingly.

If either party is not satisfied with the mediator's decision, they can appeal to a higher authority, such as a court or regulatory body. The smart contract can include a mechanism for escalating the dispute to a higher authority if necessary.

Overall, the dispute resolution mechanism in the smart contract provides a fair and transparent process for resolving disputes between users and drivers. It allows both parties to present their case and provides a neutral third-party mediator to make a decision based on the evidence presented.

the Ride struct now includes a disputed flag to indicate if the ride is disputed or not. The raiseDispute function is added to allow the rider or driver to raise a dispute with a provided explanation.
