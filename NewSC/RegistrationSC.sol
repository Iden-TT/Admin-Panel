This Smart Contract uses an interface for the SSI framework to verify the identity of users and drivers. It includes two structs for drivers and users, which store their details and wallet addresses. The registerDriver and registerUser functions allow drivers and users to register themselves, respectively, as long as their identities are verified and they are not already registered. The isDriver and isUser functions can be used to check if an address is registered as a driver or user, respectively.

Note that this is a simplified example, and a real-world implementation may require additional functions and logic. Additionally, the SSI framework used in this Smart Contract would need to be developed separately and integrated with the Smart Contract.
 there are additional functions for the government to verify drivers and users based on their identity proof. The government address is stored in the contract and the onlyGovernment modifier is used to restrict access to certain functions only to the government address. The Driver and User structs now include a boolean isVerified field to indicate whether the identity proof has been verified or not.

The registerDriver and registerUser functions can be called by any address to register as a driver or user, respectively. The verifyDriver and verifyUser functions can only be called by the government address to verify the identity proof of the driver or user.

Finally, there are two additional functions isDriverVerified and isUserVerified to allow drivers and users to check their own verification status. These functions can be used by the cab booking application to determine whether a driver or user is authorized to use the platform.
the issuer is a government entity that issues verified identity proofs to cab drivers and users. The hash of the identity proof is stored on the blockchain ledger as the holder. The government entity can act as the verifier by checking the validity of the identity proof hash. The functions registerCabDriver and registerUser have been updated to include the authentication function that checks the validity of the identity proof using the checkIdentityProof function.
