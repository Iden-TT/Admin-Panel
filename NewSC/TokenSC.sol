/*
This Smart Contract allows users to buy and sell tokens using Ether as well as exchange tokens for traditional currency and vice versa. The tokenName, tokenSymbol, and tokenPrice variables define the token being exchanged and its value. The tokenBalance mapping keeps track of the user's token balances.

The buyTokens() function allows users to purchase tokens by sending Ether to the contract. The function calculates the number of tokens based on the Ether amount and adds the tokens to the user's balance.

The sellTokens() function allows users to sell tokens for Ether. The function checks that the user has enough tokens to sell and that the contract has sufficient balance to fulfill the request. The function then transfers the Ether amount to the user's address and deducts the sold tokens from their balance.

The exchangeTokensForCurrency() function allows users to exchange their tokens for traditional currency. The function checks that the user has enough tokens to exchange and performs the currency exchange based on the currency type.

The exchangeCurrencyForTokens() function allows users to exchange their traditional currency for tokens. The function performs the currency exchange based on the currency type and calculates the number of tokens based on the token price. The tokens are then added to the user's balance.

Overall, this Smart Contract provides a flexible and secure way for users to exchange tokens and traditional currency on a currency exchange platform.
